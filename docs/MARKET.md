# Market thesis

## Problem

Context fragmentation causes repeated work, onboarding friction, and low trust in AI assistants.

## Why now

- Teams are adopting multiple AI tools without shared memory standards.
- Data portability and governance requirements keep increasing.
- Developers prefer protocol-level interoperability over app lock-in.

## Initial ICP

- Dev-first teams (2-50 engineers)
- OSS maintainers with high issue/discussion volume
- AI product teams that need memory portability
