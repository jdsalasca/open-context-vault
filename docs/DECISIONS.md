- Chosen direction: protocol-first, not app-first.
- Reason: maximize adoption by making it easy for any tool to integrate.
- Initial target users: indie builders, OSS maintainers, small product teams.
- Success metric for first month: 10 external repos using the schema.

## Open questions

- Should we support JSONL in v0.1 or wait for v0.2?
